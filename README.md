## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garbarok/bank.git
cd bank
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application with the launcher (recommended):

```bash
python src/main.py
```

2. Choose your preferred application mode:

   - **Desktop Application**: Traditional UI that runs locally
   - **Web Application**: Runs a web server with a system tray icon, accessible from any device on your network

3. Alternatively, you can run the web application directly:

```bash
python run_web_app.py
```

### Desktop Application

The desktop application provides a traditional UI with:

- File management directly in the application
- Multiple tabs for different views
- Interactive charts embedded in the application

### Web Application

The web application offers:

- Access from any device on your network (via browser)
- Modern, responsive UI
- System tray icon for quick access
- Same functionality as the desktop version

When you start the web application:

1. A system tray icon will appear
2. Your default browser will open to http://localhost:5000
3. Other devices on your network can access it via http://your-ip-address:5000

### Using Either Version

Both versions allow you to:

- Load and analyze Excel files
- Filter transactions by month
- View transactions by category
- Generate interactive charts
- Export results to Excel

## File Format

The application expects Excel files exported from BBVA online banking with the following structure:

- Sheet name: "Informe BBVA"
- Required columns: Fecha, Concepto, Movimiento, Importe, Divisa
- Data should start from row 5 (first 4 rows are headers)

## Troubleshooting

1. If you get an error loading files:

   - Ensure the Excel file is in the correct format
   - Check that the sheet name is "Informe BBVA"
   - Verify the data starts from row 5

2. If charts don't display:

   - For desktop version: Ensure matplotlib is properly installed
   - For web version: Check that your browser supports JavaScript and Plotly

3. If the web application is not accessible from other devices:
   - Check your firewall settings
   - Ensure you're using the correct IP address
   - Verify port 5000 is not blocked
